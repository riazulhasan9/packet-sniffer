# Packet-Sniffer

## Objective

This project focuses on building a simple yet powerful tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic using Python. The goal was to understand how raw packets can be captured in real time, saved to a pcap file, and then analyzed to gain insights such as identifying frequently communicating IP addresses. The project combines practical scripting with tools like Wireshark to deepen knowledge of network behavior and traffic patterns.


### Skills Learned

- Learned how to capture live network traffic using Python and Scapy
- Gained experience in analyzing packet captures to extract useful information
- Improved understanding of TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, and HTTP protocols
- Explored the use of Wireshark for deeper traffic inspection
- Practiced writing automation scripts for real-world cybersecurity tasks
- Developed confidence in interpreting and working with raw network data

### Tools Used

- Python 3 with the Scapy library for packet sniffing and analysis
- Wireshark for visual inspection of network traffic
- A terminal or command-line environment for running the scripts
- Linux machine with network access

## Steps
### Ref 1: Capturing packets using the sniffer script

This screenshot shows the terminal while running the Python script that captures 100 packets and saves them to a pcap file. The script uses Scapy and can be run with just one command.
